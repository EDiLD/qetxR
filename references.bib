	abstract = {Summary 1. Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The ‘marginal’ testing method implemented in the ‘vegan’ R package and the ‘forward’ testing method implemented in the program {CANOCO} were found to have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal description of the ‘marginal’ and ‘forward’ testing methods.},

The first chapters consider fundamental concepts and definitions essential to understanding the fate and effects of toxicants at various levels of ecological organization as covered in the remaining chapters. Scientific ecotoxicology and associated topics are defined. The historical perspective, rationale, and characteristics are outlined for the strong inferential and quantitative approach advocated in this book. The general measurement process is discussed, and methodologies for defining and controlling variance, which could otherwise exclude valid conclusions regarding ecotoxicological endeavors, are {considered.Ecotoxicological} concepts at increasing levels of ecological organization are discussed in the second part of the book. Quantitative methods used to measure toxicant effects are outlined in this section. The final chapter summarizes the book with a brief discussion of ecotoxicological assessment. Numerous figures and tables accompany text, with many statistical tables found in the appendix for quick reference. Although the book primarily focuses on aquatic systems, with appropriate modification the concepts and methods can be applied to terrestrial systems"--},

	abstract = {Community effects of low toxicant concentrations are obscured by a multitude of confounding factors. To resolve this issue for community test systems, we propose a trait-based approach to detect toxic effects. An experiment with outdoor stream mesocosms was established 2-years before contamination to allow the development of biotic interactions within the community. Following pulse contamination with the insecticide thiacloprid, communities were monitored for additional 2 years to observe long-term effects. Applying a priori ecotoxicological knowledge species were aggregated into trait-based groups that reflected stressor-specific vulnerability of populations to toxicant exposure. This reduces inter-replicate variation that is not related to toxicant effects and enables to better link exposure and effect. Species with low intrinsic sensitivity showed only transient effects at the highest thiacloprid concentration of 100 μg/l. Sensitive multivoltine species showed transient effects at 3.3 μg/l. Sensitive univoltine species were affected at 0.1 μg/l and did not recover during the year after contamination. Based on these results the new indicator {SPEAR} mesocosm was calculated as the relative abundance of sensitive univoltine taxa. Long-term community effects of thiacloprid were detected at concentrations 1,000 times below those detected by the {PRC} (Principal Response Curve) approach. We also found that those species, characterised by the most vulnerable trait combination, that were stressed were affected more strongly by thiacloprid than non-stressed species. We conclude that the grouping of species according to toxicant-related traits enables identification and prediction of community response to low levels of toxicants and that additionally the environmental context determines species sensitivity to toxicants.},

	title = {Analyzing effects of pesticides on invertebrate communities in streams},
	volume = {24},
	abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to find patterns in aquatic invertebrate community composition that are related to the effects of pesticides. Investigations were carried out in 20 central European streams. To reduce the site-specific variation of community descriptors due to environmental factors other than pesticides, species were classified and grouped according to their vulnerability to pesticides. They were classified as species at risk ({SPEAR)} and species not at risk ({SPEnotAR).} Ecological traits used to define these groups were sensitivity to toxicants, generation time, migration ability, and presence of aquatic stages during time of maximum pesticide application. Results showed that measured pesticide concentrations of 1 : 10 of the acute 48-h median lethal concentration ({LC50)} of Daphnia magna led to a short- and long-term reduction of abundance and number of {SPEAR} and a corresponding increase in {SPEnotAR.} Concentrations of 1 : 100 of the acute 48-h {LC50} of D. magna correlated with a long-term change of community composition. However, number and abundance of {SPEAR} in disturbed stream sections are increased greatly when undisturbed stream sections are present in upstream reaches. This positive influence compensated for the negative effect of high concentrations of pesticides through recolonization. The results emphasize the importance of considering ecological traits and recolonization processes on the landscape level for ecotoxicological risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Assessment of ecological impacts of toxicants relies currently on extrapolation of effects observed at organismal or population levels. The uncertainty inherent to such extrapolations, together with the impossibility of predicting ecological effects of chemical mixtures, can only be resolved by adopting approaches that consider toxicological endpoints at a community or ecological level. Experimental data from micro- and mesocosms provide estimates of community effect levels, which can then be used to confirm or correct the extrapolations from theoretical methods such as species sensitivity distributions ({SSDs)} or others. When assessing impacts, the choice of sensitive community endpoints is important. Four community endpoints (species richness, abundance, diversity and similarity indices) were evaluated in their ability to assess impacts of two insecticides, imidacloprid and etofenprox, and their mixture on aquatic and benthic communities from artificial rice paddies. Proportional changes of each community endpoint were expressed by ratios between their values in the treatment and control paddies. Regression lines fitted to the endpoint ratios against the time series of chemical concentrations were used to predict percentile impacts in the communities. The abundance endpoint appears to be the most sensitive indicator of the communities' response, but the Czekanowski similarity index described best the structural changes that occur in all communities. Aquatic arthropods were more sensitive to the mixture of both insecticides than zooplankton and benthic communities. Estimated protective levels for 95\% of aquatic species exposed to imidacloprid ({\textless}0.01-1.0 mug l(-1)) were slightly lower than predicted by {SSD}, whereas for etofenprox the protective concentrations in water ({\textless}0.01-0.58 mug l(-1)) were an order of magnitude lower than {SSD's} predictions.},

The long-term effects of the insecticide chlorpyrifos on the invertebrate community and the dissolved oxygen ({DO)-pH-alkalinity-conductivity} syndrome, in outdoor experimental ditches, are used as example data. The new method, which we have named the principal response curve method ({PRC)}, is based on redundancy analysis ({RDA)}, adjusted for overall changes in community response over time, as observed in control test systems. This allows the method to focus on the time-dependent treatment effects. The principal component is plotted against time, yielding a principal response curve of the community for each treatment. The {PRC} method distills the complexity of time-dependent, community-level effects of pollutants into a graphic form that can be appreciated more readily than the results of other currently available multivariate techniques. The {PRC} method also enables a quantitative interpretation of effects towards the species level.},

	abstract = {The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods},
